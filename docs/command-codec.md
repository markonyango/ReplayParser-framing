# WorldCommand custom data

This note narrows the part of a replay command after the receiver field. It is
based on the exported `SimEngine.dll` methods and the call sites in the
analysed `DOW2.exe`; the binaries and disassembly are deliberately not checked
into this repository. The command's `custom_type` byte is a gameplay command
namespace. It is separate from the internal data-kind byte used by
`SimCommandData` and from attribute blueprint/group IDs.

The framing is described in [`replay-format.md`](replay-format.md). The
dependency-free [`tools/replay_command_inventory.py`](../tools/replay_command_inventory.py)
reports opcode, custom type, payload length, and receiver-kind combinations
without publishing payloads. The five checked repository samples observe 26
distinct `(custom_type, payload_length)` pairs. A sixth local replay (header
version 10320, SHA-256 prefix `18d36894`) adds opcodes 9 and 58 but no new
custom type/length pair. Across those six distinct files the observed custom
types include 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25--29, and 39. These are
observations, not a complete enum: an absent type may simply not occur in the
sample corpus.

The six-file corpus contains 27 opcode values. The inventory's complete
opcode-to-observed custom shape map is below; `none` means custom type `0xff`.
This is a corpus map, not a semantic opcode enum.

## Wire facts

`WorldCommandWriteStream` writes the following fields in order:

* The command opcode is one byte. The sender/flags byte is one byte. The
  serializer obtains the sender's player ID and subtracts the engine's player
  base; a null sender becomes `0x7f`. The high bit is the command process type.
* `WorldCommand::GetReserved()` returns four bytes and the serializer copies
  all four bytes verbatim. Their observed `u16`-plus-sequence pattern is useful
  for correlation, but their semantics are not established.
* A single receiver is emitted as a packed **big-endian** word
  `(receiver_type << 28) | instance_id`. A receiver list has a tagged count in
  big endian, followed by each packed receiver word in **little endian**. The
  receiver decoder masks the type to two bits in this build. Types 0, 1, and 2
  are player, entity, and squad; the type is not an attribute blueprint ID.
* `custom_type` is `0xff` for no custom data. Otherwise the length is one byte
  for values below `0x80`, or two bytes where the first byte has its high bit
  set and carries length bits 14..8. Payload bytes are copied exactly. The
  serializer does not write the `trusted` flag.

The sender high bit is backed by a native field rather than inferred solely
from replay bytes: `WorldCommand::GetCommandProcessType` returns object offset
`+0x04`, and `WorldCommand::IsQueued` returns true exactly when that field is
`1`. The writer emits that same value as the sender byte's high bit. This is
the evidence for the commonly called *queue/process flag*; other queue state
is held by `WorldCommandQueue` and is not serialized in this command body.

The static writer/reader evidence is at DOW2 virtual addresses `0x41e8da`
through `0x41ed80`, receiver helpers `0x41e61b` and `0x41e5c8`, and the
decoder path beginning at `0x41ebcc`. The corresponding SimEngine exports are
`WorldCommand::SetCustomDataRaw`, `SimCommandData::GetUnsignedFromCustom`, and
`SimCommandData::GetTargetFromCustom`.

The SimEngine constructors also make the important object offsets explicit:

| object offset | native field |
| ---: | --- |
| `+0x00` | command opcode (`u32` in memory; one byte on the replay wire) |
| `+0x04` | command process/queued value |
| `+0x08` | constructor-initialized zero; not serialized by the writer |
| `+0x0c` | sender `Player*` |
| `+0x10` | receiver vector storage |
| `+0x40` | custom payload pointer |
| `+0x44` | custom payload length |
| `+0x48` | custom type (`0xff` sentinel) |
| `+0x49` | trusted boolean; not serialized by the writer |

This layout explains why a replay decoder should preserve the wire opcode as a
byte and should not treat the in-memory command word or `trusted` state as
additional replay fields.

## SimCommandData codec

SimEngine's `SimCommandData` helpers make a useful distinction that was
missing from the old action tables:

1. A **custom type** selects a command handler's data contract. In the
   analysed build, `GetUnsignedFromCustom` switches on custom types 5 through
   9. Type 5 takes a four-byte unsigned value directly; this is independently
   visible in replay samples where type 5 has length four and little-endian
   values such as `bf 00 00 00`. Types 6, 8, and 9 use typed unpackers, while
   type 7 deliberately returns failure. None of these values is globally
   meaningful without the calling opcode.
2. `GetTargetFromCustom` has a separate switch for target-bearing custom types
   (the call site explicitly special-cases types 25 and 26). Its result is a
   `Target` structure, not a receiver word. A target may therefore identify a
   location or another simulation object while the command receiver identifies
   the controller that receives the command. The complete gameplay meaning of
   each target case is not established by the generic helper alone.

The complete dispatch behavior recoverable from those two helpers is:

| custom tag | `GetTargetFromCustom` | `GetUnsignedFromCustom` | proven data path |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | success | reject | single target |
| 2 | success | reject | single target + bool |
| 3 | success | reject | dual target |
| 4 | success | reject | dual target + bool |
| 5 | reject | success | direct `u32` flag |
| 6 | success | success | flag + target |
| 7 | reject | reject | unsupported by these generic helpers |
| 8 | success | success | flag + dual target |
| 9 | reject | success | flag + position |
| 10--24 | reject | reject | no generic helper arm located |
| 25--26 | caller-specific | reject | target-bearing handlers special-case these tags |
| 27--255 | reject | reject | preserve raw payload; handler-specific or unknown |

“Reject” here means the helper returns false; it does not mean that a command
with that tag cannot exist. The replay inventory demonstrates tags 12, 15, 16,
18, 19, 25--29, and 39, so a decoder must retain unknown/custom-handler
payloads rather than applying the generic table blindly.

The boundary between structural decoding and semantic decoding is therefore:

| wire area | supported structural decode | semantic coverage | required fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| command envelope | opcode, sender/process byte, four reserved bytes, receiver field, custom type/length | no complete opcode dispatch recovered | retain every byte and expose the opcode as an integer |
| receiver word | `raw`, `type = raw >> 28`, `instance = raw & 0x0fffffff` | types 0=player, 1=entity, 2=squad are proven in SimEngine getters | keep unknown type nibbles raw; do not call `instance` a blueprint ID |
| custom 1--6 | generic target/flag contracts listed above | byte layout only; gameplay meaning remains opcode-specific | preserve raw payload alongside any typed view |
| custom 8--9 | flag+dual-target and flag+position contracts | byte layout only; no global ability/unit names | preserve raw payload alongside any typed view |
| custom 7 | framing and raw length/payload | generic helpers deliberately reject it; DOW2 has a writer call site | opaque custom payload |
| custom 12, 15--19, 25--29, 39 | framing and raw length/payload | caller-specific or unresolved; 25/26 take local DOW2 branches | opaque custom payload until an opcode/version handler is supplied |
| all other custom values | framing and raw length/payload | no generic helper arm recovered | opaque custom payload |
| opcode byte | one-byte value for every command | 27 values occur in the six-file corpus; no complete enum | retain the byte and avoid inferred action names |

The masks that are proven by the native code are intentionally small. For a
sender/process byte, `sender = byte & 0x7f` and `process = (byte >> 7) & 1`.
For the internal `SimCommandData` discriminator, `kind = byte & 0x7f` and
`bool = (byte >> 7) & 1`; only low kinds 2, 3, 4, and 5 have recovered
dispatch arms. For a packed receiver, the writer places the namespace in the
top nibble and the receiver instance in the low 28 bits. The generic receiver
decoder masks the namespace to two bits for its known paths, but preserving the
original nibble is safer for a replay parser. No additional bitfield inside
the three target words has been established. In particular, the third target
word must not be presented as a blueprint, purchase, or unit ID.

The custom length has its own framing rule and is not a target bitfield: values
below `0x80` use one byte; otherwise the length is
`((first & 0x7f) << 8) | second`, with the high bit serving only as the
two-byte marker.

## Using the recovered fields

The dependency-free tools are intended to be the first pass over a replay:

```text
python3 tools/replay_inspect.py recs/purchases_SM.rec
python3 tools/replay_command_inventory.py recs/purchases_SM.rec
```

Both commands emit JSON structural summaries. The inventory reports opcode,
custom type/length, and receiver-kind counts without publishing payload bytes.
The Rust parser emits a JSON `commands` array containing every decoded command;
each command has `opcode`, `sender_flags`, `sender_slot`, `process_type`,
`raw_context`, `receivers`, `custom_type`, `custom_length`, and `custom_data`.
`data` remains the complete command body for byte-for-byte consumers. The
legacy `actions` array is filtered for compatibility and should not be used as
the complete command stream.

For a local JSON dump, run `cargo run -p parser_lib -- path/to/file.rec`.
Consumers adding typed views should retain the raw command and make the typed
fields conditional on both custom type and opcode/version. A type-5 four-byte
value, for example, is a command-context token; it is not a cross-version
blueprint or unit identifier. Unknown tags and unknown opcodes should remain
visible in JSON rather than being dropped.

The typed `SimCommandData` classes expose pack/unpack methods. Their static
   call sequences establish the following payload composition, with primitive
   values written in the engine's little-endian stream format:

   | class | pack sequence proven by call sites |
   | --- | --- |
   | `SingleTargetData` | one generic target |
   | `SingleTargetBoolData` | one generic target, then one bool byte |
   | `DualTargetData` | two generic targets |
   | `DualTargetBoolData` | two generic targets, then one bool byte |
   | `FlagData` | one four-byte value |
   | `FlagTargetData` | one generic target, then one four-byte value |
   | `FlagTargetBoolData` | one generic target, one four-byte value, one bool byte |
   | `FlagDualTargetData` | two generic targets, then one four-byte value |
   | `FlagPositionData` | one four-byte value, then a position (12 bytes for the plain position path; a 3-byte compact path is selected for a non-null simulation object) |
   | `SquadCustomData` | squad pointer/identity packer, with the exact object identity resolved by the squad manager |

   The generic data-kind byte used by the packer has values 2 through 5 for
   target, position, entity, and squad paths. Its high bit carries a boolean
   flag. This byte is internal to the `SimCommandData` codec; it must not be
   confused with the command `custom_type` byte. The target path carries three
   primitive words (the disassembly copies two words and a third word); the
   position path carries three 32-bit words in the plain form. The entity and
   squad paths resolve through the world manager, so a replay-only decoder
   should retain their raw bytes unless it has the matching simulation state.

The exported functions and RVAs provide reproducible anchors for this table:

```text
SimCommandData::GetUnsignedFromCustom    0x10021c70
SimCommandData::GetTargetFromCustom      0x10021e00

SquadCustomData::Pack/Unpack               0x10021ba0 / 0x10021c20
```

## What replay samples establish

The inventory shows stable, contextual patterns rather than a global ID table.
In `purchases_SM.rec`, opcode 3 repeatedly targets entity instance `19055`
(`0x10004a6f`) while its type-5 payload values vary (219, 221, 216, 215,
217). Opcode 50 targets squad instance `50000` (`0x2000c350`) with a type-5
value of 407. This proves that a type-5 u32 is a command-specific token; it is
not a universally comparable blueprint ID. The same numeric token can only be
named after following the opcode's gameplay handler and the corresponding
version's attribute tables.

The supplied static evidence does **not** prove a complete purchase or ability
name map, a queue flag enum, or the meaning of every opcode. In particular,
the command process bit and the receiver list are wire facts, while queueing,
purchase tokens, ability selection, positions, and target semantics remain
opcode- and version-specific. A safe parser should preserve the opcode,
reserved bytes, custom type, custom length, raw payload, receiver type, and
receiver instance even when it cannot assign a gameplay name.

## Writer-side dispatch and opaque cases

The native writer does not contain a central `custom_type -> Pack` table. The
DOW2 code constructs a `ByteStreamAdapter`, sets the command object's `+0x48`
custom type, and calls `WorldCommand::SetCustomData` through the DOW2 import at
`0xf880c0`. `WorldCommandWriteStream` then frames that already-built byte
buffer. This is why the generic SimEngine helper switches are useful for
decoding known data classes, but cannot be used as an enum for every custom
type found in replays.

The following literal assignments are direct writer-side evidence in the
analysed DOW2 build. The second address is the nearby `SetCustomData` call;
the addresses are RVA-style virtual addresses from the disassembly:

| custom type | assignment | nearby write call | evidence |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `0x7ed544` | `0x7ed56f` | caller builds a single-target-shaped buffer |
| 2 | `0x9413df` | `0x94140e` | caller-specific builder |
| 3 | `0x9412df` | `0x94130e` | caller-specific builder |
| 5 | `0x7ed4c4` | `0x7ed4ef` | four-byte flag/unsigned builder |
| 6 | `0x9411cf` | `0x9411fe` | caller-specific builder |
| 7 | `0x941364` | `0x94138f` | written by DOW2 although generic readers reject it |
| 8 | `0xb7fe4f` | `0xb7fe7e` | caller-specific builder |
| 12 | `0xa02c6f` | `0xa02c9e` | `SquadCustomData::Pack` call site |
| 25 | `0x8768a4` | `0x8768ce` | local builder at `0x814180` |
| 41 | `0x41e57f` | `0x41e5a2` | local builder |

This list is a set of call-site facts, not a semantic tag enum. It proves that
type 7 is a valid writer-side value even though neither generic helper
decodes it. It also shows that type 25 is produced by a local DOW2 builder.
The analysed writer has no immediate type-9 assignment adjacent to a
`SetCustomData` call; type 9 is nevertheless a real generic **reader** arm in
`GetUnsignedFromCustom`, where it uses the flag-position unpacker. Types
0/26--29 and 39 occur in object initialization or replay samples, but no
single central pack dispatch for them was recovered.

Types 25 and 26 are explicitly handled outside the generic helpers. At DOW2
`0x814350`, the command's `+0x48` is compared against 25 and 26: type 25 is
sent to local routine `0x7ecc40`, type 26 to local routine `0x7ecd00`, and
other values fall through to `GetUnsignedFromCustom`. At `0x814418`, type 26
again takes the local `0x7ecd00` path while other values call
`GetTargetFromCustom`. These branches prove caller-specific target handling;
they do not prove the fields or gameplay names of the 25/26 payloads. The
observed type-26 lengths (9, 11, and 19 bytes) must therefore remain raw until
that local routine and its callers are decoded.

The generic packer has a second, unrelated discriminator inside the payload.
At SimEngine `0x10022780`, it writes `kind | (bool ? 0x80 : 0)` from a
`SimCommandData` object, and at `0x100228a0` the reader masks the high bit and
dispatches the low seven bits. Low values 2, 3, 4, and 5 select the target,
position, entity, and squad paths respectively. For the plain target path the
following data is three little-endian 32-bit words, so the internal kind byte
plus those 12 bytes explains the observed 13-byte target payload. The high
bit is proven as a boolean carrier; the remaining target metadata words and
the meaning of any other low-bit value are not proven by this dispatch. A
decoder should retain the discriminator and all words rather than treating
the third word as a blueprint or unit ID.

The generic unpack switch has no arm for an unknown low-bit kind and returns
without a typed result. That is a useful implementation boundary: the parser
can fully decode the framing and the nine generic custom contracts above, but
must expose an opaque payload for caller-specific tags (including 7, 12,
15--19, 25--29, 39, and any future value) unless an opcode/version-specific
handler is supplied. No RTTI or virtual stream metadata in the analysed
exports provides the missing custom-tag-to-handler mapping.
